Description of  The Game Futures:


-The Game starts through a Control Panel that let you choose a player and then click a button Start. 

- I have added a second, zoomed view of the world to the main frame and a control button to exit the game.

- The player collects coins and lives. I have learned how to use Collision Listeners.

- I have added keyboard control to the Player using keyPressed and keyReleased methods in switch statements.

- The amount of lives is decreased when the Player collides with a bowl object or an enemy crocodile. 

-There are 4 levels, which change through a switch statement if a  change level condition is met.

- There are different background Images for each Level

- I have used FSM for the bowl object, which has 3 states: still, roll - left and roll-right. The body Image of the bowl is modified through a 

collision event with the Player when no more lives are left.

- It was challenging to figure out how to do that for all levels, but I managed to implement it. 

- I have learned how to use a class within a class, which can be seen in the Main Game class.

- The game has 4 different Dynamic bodies interacting with each other.

- I have added a GameVideo and  a JavaDoc in the zipped file.

This project has helped a lot my understanding of OO Design through the use of Interfaces, Inheritance, encapsulation, and
I have learned to tackle most of the Null Pointer Exceptions. 
I feel that with more practice I will be able to implement more complex behaviours.
